#Aged SeedBank Single Cell Model

This is a seedbank bank single cell model, where the population produces seeds that may be stored in the seedbank, or may germinate into a plant

Seeds from the seedbank may germinate at a later date, but do not survive past 2 steps

Environmental factors are not included in this model for the likelihood of germination and living rates

##Code
main.py contains the model

tools.py contains functions for graphing, and other functions not related to the model

##Graphs
population_plot.gif is a graph of the density of the population in the cell over time

seedbank_plot.gif is a graph of the seeds in both aged seedbanks in the cell over time
